PhotoPrint-0.4.2

  * Clear Layout no longer causes a segfault if there is more than one image.

  * Migrated Scaling dialog to SimpleCombo

  * Added hints to Colour Management dialog

  * Added support for CUPS -o option sideband - should make it easier
    to use HPLIP- and TurboPrint-driven printers.

  * Migrated high-res preview code to the new JobQueue system - should be more stable,
    better behaved on Win32, and more maintainable.

  * Reinstated delay before drawing HR preview - should improve responsiveness on
    Win32.

  * Updated nl translation - thanks to Kenny Verstraete

  * Updated cs translation - thanks to Marek Černocký

  * Export dialogs now set the default path to CSIDL_COMMON_PICTURES on Win32.
    Thanks to David Stone for pointing out the incorrect path that was previously being used.

  * Poster mode now has gridlines to show the boundaries and overlaps of each page.

  * Now has Gamma effect.

  * No longer segfaults if sRGB built-in is assigned to an image.

  * Fixed problem with shortcut menu when duplicate shortcuts are installed under different paths.

  * Added dialog for setting rendering resolution.

  * Fixed a hang-on-exit bug if fetching an image failed.

  * Grey images with embedded profiles are now supported.

  * Added Italian translation, with thanks to Alfonso Cavaliere


PhotoPrint-0.4.1

  * Added cs localization - thanks to Petr Kletecka.  Thanks also to Marek Černocký
	and Frantisek Hanzlik who also supplied Czech localizations.  In the interests
	of fairness I've used the first one I received!

  * Fixed bug whereby the border and background paths are ignored if there's no
	preset file.

  * Fixed default driver bugs for when there's no preset.

  * Added po localization - thanks to Artur Szymanski

  * Borders pack is now part of the main PhotoPrint archive

  * Fixed bug with top margin in Single layout mode.  Hopefully this will now
    *finally* work correctly.

  * Reworked some of the printer subsystem - should fix problems people have been
	experiencing with the -oraw flag, and should also be generally more robust.
    Needs more testing.

  * Fixed bug where dropping a bad file into PhotoPrint caused the current image to
    become unselectable until either page or layout was changed.

  * Refactored much of the threading code.

  * Added Histogram display

  * Expanders now remember their state between sessions

  * Added nl localization - thanks to Lex Wernars.

  * Reworked the SimpleCombo widget for friendlier option definitions.

  * Fixed a deadlock problem with the histogram

  * Print preview dialog implemented at last.  This is done as a full-screen window
    with auto-hiding control-panel.  The reason for this is that when evaluating
    colours, especially in print simulation mode, UI elements can throw off your
    perception of colour.

  * Updated cs translation - thanks to Marek Černocký.

  * About dialog text and "Default" entry for rendering intent are now translated.

  * ImageInfo and Effects now work in Single Layout.

  * Added "Supplementary Preset" (Shortcut) capability.

  * Added shortcuts for Profiling on Letter and A4 paper, and for a few standard
    photo sizes, also on Letter and A4 paper.

  * Nup control box now correctly updates if the units are changed while in 
    "Specify size" mode.

  * Added de localization - thanks to Heinrich Schwietering

  * Fixed missing "else" which resulted in settings being reset on queue change even
    if the driver hadn't changed.

  * Rotation now support the general case.

  * Migrated image list from GList to STL list, and a separate Iterator in the process.

  * Fixed bugs with crop and rotation menu items.

  * Added a "Printer Response Hash", which runs a simple image through the printer driver
    and generates an MD5 hash of the printer data so generated.

  * Reduced shell-window pollution by adding a debug level system.

  * Fixes to dlocalization - thanks to Heinrich Schwietering


PhotoPrint-0.4.0

  * Fixed a bug which caused the Custom Command and File print queues to be
    repeated when there were no CUPS queues detected.

  * Hopefully fixed yet another crash-upon-start-with-no-preset bug - and the
    random page-size behaviour if the default queue is a PostScript queue.

  * Added some error messages if the user attempts to choose a proofing mode
    without the requisite colour profiles set up.

  * Moved non-PhotoPrint-specific Gutenprint infrastructure out to separate
	gp_cppsupport library.

  * ProfileSelector now catches and ignores corrupt profiles

  * Fixed a possible segfault if source and destination profiles are the same

  * Fixed a segfault if the user attemps to open the Image -> Set Colour Profile...
	dialog with no images selected.

  * Fixed another possible segfaul with default PPD file, in photoprint_state.cpp

  * More changes to mask routines, hopefully finally got min-is-white greyscale
    images and max-is-full-opacity alpha channels resolved.

  * Updated Russian translation - thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine.

  * Added ability to specify cell size for n-up layout

  * Added button to set the cell size to the natural size of the currently selected image

  * Fixed left/top margin issue for single layout (at last).

  * Fixed glitch in TIFF Loader - unitialized resolution variables if the image has no
	resolution set.

  * Fixed bug in .desktop file - now asks for Filenames (%F) not URIs (%U)

  * Solved problem with margins not being saved in Single, Poster and Carousel modes

  * Fixed a threading bug which caused stale CMSTransforms to be used when changing proof mode

  * Fixed drag-and-drop problem with KDE4.

  * Added mechanism for interruption to lengthy ImageSource operations.  Added support for this
    to rotation routines.  Improves the UI responsiveness in high-res-preview mode.

  * Fixed a deadlock / segfault condition which showed up under Win32.


PhotoPrint-0.3.9

  * Fixed a bug where vertical offsets and cropping were ignored when images
    are downsampled.

  * Threads code should now work on Win32

  * SearchPath class renamed to avoid Win32 name clash

  * Resolved a couple of other Win32 build issues

  * Hopefully fixed custom page size bug for borderless mode

  * Fixed a resolution bug in the TIFF loader - a decimal point in the wrong place!

  * Hopefully fixed a papersize bug which afflicted papersizes not normally known
    to Gutenprint, but specified within a PPD file.

  * ProfileManager can now use the LCMS inbuilt sRGB profile.

  * Added physical size and resolution information to the ImageInfo widget.

  * Fixed a bug with high-res previews and rotation.

  * Effects are now copied when duplicating images.


PhotoPrint-0.3.8b

  * Nasty exception-handling bug in the multi-threaded high-res previews fixed.

  * Single layout supports fractional percentage scaling.


PhotoPrint-0.3.8

  * Fixed some minor errors causing compilation problems in some instances.
    Thanks for Hubert Figuiere for pointing these out and supplying a patch.

  * Fixed broken compilation if libcups-devel is missing.

  * Configure script will now bail out if either libtiff or libjpeg is missing.

  * Added ability to save 16-bit data to TIFFSaver and export.

  * Reworked ProfileSelector to show Descriptive names rather than filenames,
    and to use tooltips rather than a separate label box to show ancillary
    information (i.e. the filename).

  * Vastly improved implementation of the Downsample filter - no longer results
    in dark edges when the reduction is slight, and no longer slightly darkens
    the whole image.

  * Fixed an FD leak in the ImageInfo widget that would lead to a crash after
	several hundred refreshes of the Manual and Poster layouts.

  * Added a pixbufview widget, which will be used to implement Print Preview.

  * BMP Loader can now handle 32-bit RGBA BMP files.

  * Print Setup dialog now hides inactive options, rather than merely greying
    them out.

  * Added copy constructor and better handling of virtual profiles to lcmswrapper

  * Support for high-resolution previews.  The low-res previews are used initially
	for speed, then a sub-thread renders a high-resolution preview.
	Lots of "interesting" issues still to resolve with the introduction of
	multi-threading!

  * Created a new RWMutex similar to pthreads rwlocks but explicitly capable of
    dealing with recursion, and mixing lock types.

  * Effects are now properly applied to low-res previews before the final
	colour management transform - thus images rendered grey by the Desaturate widget
    now correctly mimic paper-white/grey in Simulate Print mode.

  * Images can now be duplicated on the page - both singly and to fill the page.

  * Improved performance of the high-resolution rendering thread system.

  * Scaling routines are now split into separate horizontal and vertical stages
    so the image processing engine can now use different filters for the
    two dimensions.

  * Previews with alpha channel now composite against the correct background colour
    (only makes a difference in Paper-simulation mode).

  * Support added to the Montage routine for RGBA colour space - needed to fix the
    above for the Carousel preview.


PhotoPrint-0.3.7

  *	Hopefully fixed a papersize bug.
  
  * The Rotation and Allow Cropping settings are now stored in the preset
    files, and are thus now usable in batch mode.

  * Fixed a bug in the Dimension widgets when working in Points.

  * JPEG Export dialog no longer suggests "exported.tif" as a suitable filename!

  * JPEG Export dialog now contains a spin button for setting the export Quality.

  * Started reorganising User Interface.  Layout controls are now more compact.
    Frames have been replaced with expanders, to allow the right-hand pane to be
    better used with image manipulation controls.

  * The background image preview now works again.

  * Added an ImageInfo widget which displays the filename, dimensions and applied
    colour profile of a selected image.

  * Now displays a dialog on preset loading if the printer queue specified in the
    preset doesn't exist, allowing the user to change queues in this case without
    resetting the printer settings.

  * Fixed a segfault upon 180-degree rotation of large images.

  * Fixed a problem with CMYK->RGB conversion in the thumbnail code.

  * Re-worked the EffectSelector widget, and embedded it into the main control panel.

  * Refactored a lot of the Effect-handling code, and created a new widget for
    the Colour Temperature changer.

  * Fixed a bug in the Carousel mode which sometimes prevented images being panned.

  * Unavailable image operations are now correctly greyed out in the popup menu.
  
  * Added Unsharp Mask effect.

  * Effects can now be applied to multiple images simultaneously.
  
  * Now uses CUPS, if available, to enumerate the available printer queues.


PhotoPrint-0.3.6

  * Fixed a segfault in the rotation routines.

  * Fixed a problem with the TIFF Loader - it now loads the first page of multi-page
    Images, instead of the second.  This was causing the thumbnail rather than the main
    image to be used in some cases.

  * Portuguese (Brazilian) translation added.  Many thanks for Krishnamurti Lelis Lima
    Vieira Nunes for this.  Krishnamurti's translation will currently be used both by
    Brazilian and European Portuguese locales - if anyone would like to adjust the
    European translation to better suit the European style it would be much appreciated.

  * Fixed a bug which caused a floating-point exception at startup if there was no
    default.preset file.

  * Spanish translation added.  Many thanks to Redy Rodriguez for this.


PhotoPrint-0.3.5

  * Can now fetch a profile attached to a display, using the _ICC_PROFILE atom
    described by Ross Burton's XICC specification.   (X11 only - does anyone
    know how to do the equivalent under Win32?)

  * Embedded profiles in JPEG images are now used.

  * First stab at an effects dialog, allowing various modifications to an image
    on the page.  Currently implemented:
    * Desaturate - replace each of RGB with (R+G+B)/3.
    * Cool/Warm - uses LCMS virtual profiles to adjust the colour temperature
      of an image.  Very useful for black-and-white photographs, if you wish to
      print them cooler or warmer than your printer's neutral grey.
    (Yes, I know this dialog sucks - it will be replaced with something better
    in due course!)

  * Migrated the menus to GtkUIManager for easier translation.  Menus are
    now translated.
  
  * Custom media sizes and roll papers are now supported - but not
    comprehensively tested.

  * Fixed bug in queue selector - custom command entry now shows up if custom
    command is the initial setting.

  * Now sets the LC_ALL environment variable to "C" before building the queue
    list, fixing a parsing problem of lpstat's output when localised.

  * Fixed a unit-handling bug in the dimension widget.

  * Full translations now included for Russian and French.  Many many thanks
    to Alexandre Prokoudine and Séverin Lemaignan for their translation work.

  * Reduced the memory usage of N-up mode during printing and export.

  * Fixed 180-degree rotation bug

  * PPD file now fetched using CUPS when a Postscript-based queue is selected.

  * PrintingMode parameter now set to "Color" at print time. (Fixed segfault
    with PS driver).

  * Now includes a .desktop file (thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine) and icon.

  * Fixed profile selector - no longer bombards the user with file dialogs if
    no profiles are found on the system!


PhotoPrint-0.3.4

  * Now uses a high-quality DownSample filter when reducing images, unless
    Nearest Neighbour is specified.

  * Full print proofing is now possible - by way of a new option menu in 
    the colour management dialog.
    The options for "Display Mode" are "Normal" - i.e no proofing,
    "Simulate Print" - a proofing transform, using Absolute Colorimetric, and
    "Simulate Print, Adapt White" - proof using Relative Colorimetric.

  * Fixed the call to wait() in stp_util/printerqueues_unix.c

  * The queue handler can now capture output to a file; the unix version can
    send the print data to a custom command.

  * New, general purpose queue selector widget - allows the user to select
	between the detected printer queues, and two special purpose queues -
	<Print to file> and <Use custom print command> (UNIX only).  If the custom
	command option is selected, the widget will make a text entry available
	for entering the custom command.   No entry is made available for the
	Print to File option - instead, a callback is used to fetch a filename at
	run-time - which PhotoPrint links to a file chooser in save mode.

  * Save dialog now prompts you to confirm before over-writing an existing file.
  
  * Fixed problem with inverted image masks!  Thanks to Joel Swartz for the
    bug report.

  * Added tooltips to the IntentSelector widget, to provide a short description
    of each rendering intent.

  * Print proofing mode now adjusts the "paper white" as well as the images.

  * Internationalization support.  Just a partial Russian translation so far -
	many, many thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine for this, and for prodding me
	into implementing i18n - the infrastructure is now largely present, and
	most of the strings are marked for translation.  I'm bound to have missed
	some, though - so bug reports and more translations are *very* welcome!
	Note that currently the menus are marked for translation, but will not
	actually be translated.


PhotoPrint-0.3.3

  * Now builds and runs under Win32 (mingw)

  * Added new printer queue management routines in a new stp_support library
    This handles the unpleasant details of getting the raw data to the printer
    and abstracts away the differences between UNIX and Windows queue handling.

  * Modified the searchpath code to deal with Win32 path structure.

  * Modified the thumbnail code to deal with Win32 absolute paths.

  * Modified thumbnail code again - now uses g_path_is_absolute()
	
  * Created new routine to substitute the user's homedir into a path or filename.
    Will be used throughout to improve Win32 support.

  * Save Default menu item now stores the window geometry in the preset.

  * Now uses new GtkFileChooser instead of GtkFileSel - and hence requires
    GTK+ 2.4 or newer.

  * TIFF export is now much more flexible.  There is now a dialog for setting
    the range of pages to be printed, the resolution, and optional output colour
    profile.

  * Layout view is now colour-managed.
  
  * TIFF Export now embeds the colour profile in the generated file.

  * Worked around a problem with the pipe-to-print-command code - should prevent
    alternate print jobs failing on some systems.

  * Can now tag images with a custom profile, and set the rendering intent
    individually.


PhotoPrint-0.3.2

  * Improved the performance of the ProfileSelector widget.  The ProfileManager
    now caches the list of files, so the directories only have to be scanned once
    and the profiles only have to be opened once for filtering purposes, even
    when a dialog contains several ProfileSelectors.

  * Added preliminary support for PPDs when using the PostScript driver.

  * Reversed the direction of mask rotation to match the "Auto" image rotation.

  * Cancelling a print job no longer results in "Unable to generate print data"
    error message.

  * Cancelling a print job now actually *cancels* the job!

  * Fixed bug in imagesource_promote - Greyscale->CMYK promotion now works!

  * Cleaned up the Layouts' detection of the default colour space - used by
    the colour-space BW/Grey->RGB/CMYK "promotion" code.

  * Reverted loaders' black/white polarity, and reversed it in imagesource_promote.
    Greyscale and B/W images are now always treated as MinIsWhite - to match CMYK.

  * Hopefully fixed a segfault which showed up on some systems when there was
    no .photoprint directory.

  * Added support for "panning" cropped images - you can now click-and-drag a
    cropped image to re-frame it.

  * Added support to the n-up layout for a background image.

  * Added a path selector for background images.

  * pixbuf_from_imagesource() now supports CMYK images.

  * The ImageSelector widget (used for borders and backgrounds) now supports
    drag'n'dropping an image.


Photoprint-0.3.1

  * Fixed Greyscale BMPs printing in negative!

  * Possibly fixed bug that sometimes causes prints to be offset by about 3mm

  * Added a dedicated ProfileSelector widget

  * Created a PathEditor widget

  * Created an ImageSelector widget (used for selecting masks)

  * Added a new "Paths" dialog for selecting profile and border paths.

  * Batch mode works again
  
  * Reworked the ConfigFile code a little to ease the storing of paths.

  * Moved some of the more general-purpose and reusable UI code into support/

  * Cleaned up a minor signal-handling bug in the poster layout.

  * Should now be able to do full-bleed printing when Borderless is selected
    in the print options.

  * pixbuf_from_imagesource can now cope with GreyScale images.


PhotoPrint-0.3.0

  * Fixed uncaught exception if a bad / non-existent mask filename is provided.

  * Fixed a problem with detecting libpnm on systems that don't have it linked
    to the math library.
    
  * Fixed a double-free in imagesource_lanczossinc.cpp.

  * Added new ProfileManager class.

  * Reworked all four layout classes to use the new ProfileManager.
	Much tidier now.

  * Added some much-needed comments to the hairier parts of the
    ProfileManager.

  * DeviceLink profiles are now supported.  If the printer's profile is 
    a DeviceLink, then ordinarily the default profile is ignored; images
    that have an embedded profile are transformed first to the default
    profile and then the printer profile is applied.  Therefore, the default
    profile should be the same one used as a source profile when the DeviceLink
    was made.

  * PhotoPrint's version is now encoded into the preset files.
    The ProfileManager's parameters now have their own section within the
    preset file; PhotoPrint will automatically transfer these parameters
    from old presets, but newly-saved presets will now be incompatible with
    previous versions.


PhotoPrint-0.2.9

  * JPEG loader doesn't now initialise the decompressor until the first row
    is requested.  I'd hoped this would improve performance when querying image
    dimensions and resolution, but it seems to make no appreciable difference.

  * Layout::TransferImages now accepts a Progress object, and is cancellable.
  
  * Greyscale images are now "promoted" to RGB.
  
  * Multi-selection now works in N-Up mode, and "Remove Image", "Allow Cropping"
    and "Allow Rotation" are correctly applied to all selected images.

  * New "Image" menu - duplicating the functionality of the context menus; allows
    settings to be applied en masse.

  * Context menu is no longer handled by the individual pageview widgets; instead
    they emit a "popupmenu" signal which the pp_layout_* widget propagates back to
    the pp_mainwindow widget.

  * Layouts now provide a bitwise mask defining their capabilities; this is used to
    enable and disable entries in the menus.

  * Layouts now support explicit rotation to 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees, and also
    support "Auto" rotation - similar to the old behaviour.

  * Auto layout now supports shift-click multi-selection
  
  * Cleaned up multipage handling, which was failing to deal with the possibility
    of removing more than a pagefull of images in one go.

  * Added multi-selection to Carousel mode, plus selection highlighting.

  * Fixed a page numbering problem with the Single layout.


PhotoPrint-0.2.8

  * Fixed an uninitialised variable that was wreaking havok in stpui_combo

  * Created a search-path system for the ICC profiles.  The program will now use
    the following search paths by default (in this order):
    $HOME/.color/icc
    $HOME/.photoprint/icc
    /usr/share/color/icc
    /usr/local/share/color/icc
    When a profile is selected in the file selector, its path is checked to see
    whether it's in any of the standard paths.  If so, the path component is removed.
    The paths are checked one by one to locate the profile when it's needed.
    (This makes sharing preset files much easier, since the path to the profile is
    no longer absolute.)

  * Added #include <math.h> to imagesource_segmentmask.cpp


PhotoPrint-0.2.7

  * Added (at last!) the ability to create the .photoprint directory if necessary.

  * Splash screen no longer appears in batch mode.

  * Fixed a problem with the "changed" signal not being caught after a layout change.

  * Renamed and rearranged the layout names - Single is not useful except in
    specific circumstances, so should be less "inviting".

  * Can now cancel the adding of multiple images.

  * The problem with previewing multiple pages in poster mode is fixed.

  * The manual sizing mode now automatically shrinks newly-placed images if their
    natural size would be too large to fit the page.

  * Fixed some problems with the Carousel mode's UI.  Layout_Single was used as a
    starting point for Layout_Carousel, and I'd missed a few references to
    Layout_Single.


PhotoPrint-0.2.6

  * Fixed (I hope) the problem on some machines with the unit conversion
    macros failing.  Something seems to be interfering with the use of round()

  * Fixed a problem with the options system, which caused PhotoPrint's output to
    be considerably darker than the print plugin's with the same settings.
    WARNING: THIS WILL INVALIDATE ALL EXISTING PROFILES - but by vastly reducing
    the gamma setting you should be able to reproduce the old behaviour!

  * Added spin buttons to control number of segments and overlap for Carousel layout.

  * Fixed double free error in the layouts (transformed preview)


PhotoPrint-0.2.5

  * Added a LayoutRectangle class, with a Fit() function.
  
  * Migrated all fitting functions to use the new LayoutRectangle class
    (Went suspiciously smoothly!)

  * Fixed major screwup in the poster-mode preview caused in
    migrating to LayoutRectangle.

  * Finally added support for physical dimensions in Print Setup.
  
  * Added dummy menu item for Print Preview

  * New layout mode: Image Carousel (for CDs) - arranges the images in a circular
    fashion and blends between images.
    (It's done by placing half the images hard-masked to a segment shape, and
    overlaying the other half with an alpha blend, so only works well for an
    even number of images.)

  * Fixed bug when loading a new preset of the same type as the current preset.
    (Stale pointer to the stp_vars, which is flushed and replaced on preset load.)

  * Added routines to calculate image bounds of Image Carousel segments
    and to provide an imagesource with an appropriate mask applied.

  * Moved thumbnail drawing (common between n-up and poster mode) into the
    layout superclass, along with allowcropping and new allowrotation flags
    to replace the old cropfit flag.

  * Fixed misplaced semicolon in thumbnail "stealing" code.

  * Layout_ImageInfo now generates a thumbnail in the constructor so that
    unsupported file formats are caught earlier.

  * Masking is now implemented for the n-up, single and poster layouts.

  * "Retired" imagesource_signature.  It's too specific to belong in the general
    imagesource library, and with imagesource_montage factored out, it was very
    small anyway.  The functionality is now included in layout_nup.cpp, which
    makes adding the masks much tidier.


PhotoPrint-0.2.4

  * Added a unit widget for physical dimensions
  
  * Added rounding to neat increments to the unit widget.

  * Printer settings are now cleared before loading a preset.
  
  * Added Scaling Quality dialog.
  
  * The file selector now remembers the most recently added image.
  
  * Refactored the Montage imagesource.  Montage is now more general,
    and the specific n-up layout is now handled by a subclass,
    ImageSource_Signature.

  * Added support for alpha channels to TIFF loader and compositing functions.
  
  * Added a PS/PDF loader that generates a temporary TIFF file using GhostScript
  
  * Fixed #ifndef in rotatepixbuf.h (Thanks to regisr for pointing this out)

  * Removed dependency on ini.h in lcmswrapper.*, and created new types to
    deal with whitepoint, primaries, etc.
  
  * Created new subdirectory, "support", containing non-photoprint specific routines.
  
  * Added a splashscreen, in "splashscreen" directory.
  
  * Eliminated several compiler warnings - should now compile cleanly with -Wall
 

PhotoPrint-0.2.3

  * Added support for CMYK images
  
  * Re-worked the colour-management dialog - invalidates old presets

  * Optional parameters now have a check box to disable them

  * Fixed resetting of margins with every print-setup operation.
  
  * Relative pathnames now work
  
  * Fixed a couple of compilation warnings regarding non-virtual destructors
  
  * Fixed a C++/C99 declaration in some C code.

  * Created a Bilinear filter


PhotoPrint-0.2.2

  * Batch mode now implemented

  * Infrastructure is in place for multiple layout types,
    including swapping between them at runtime

  * Single layout now implemented
  
  * Poster layout now implemented
  
  * Added a Lanczos-windowed Sinc interpolation filter
    (currently used for scaling operations of more than 250% linear)
  
  * Infrastructure in place for selecting scaling type and
    rendering resolution at runtime.  (GUI to follow).
    Scaling strategy is currently automatically selected.

  * BMP Loader now fetches the image resolution from the file.

  * Should no longer segfault when fed a bad filename.
  
  * Layout controls are now in a scrollwindow widget, making the program
    more usable with low screen resolutions.

  * Window geometry is now saved with the preset.

  * Now allows more friendly printer configuration; displays a list of
    known printer queues, automatically generates suitable default commands,
    and (if linked against libcups) can deduce the correct Gutenprint driver
    to use.

  * A nasty bug fixed in pp_signature.cpp, where a typo was wreaking havoc with
    the sizegroup, due to a widget being added to it twice.


PhotoPrint-0.2.1

  * Now uses autotools for configuration.

  * Added a context menu to the images, allowing removal and cropping.

  * "Allow Cropping" menu item scales the image to fill the frame completely,
    as opposed to the default method, which scales as large as possible while
    still keeping the entire image within the frame.

  * Added a "crop-fit" fitting method to the ImageSource_Montage class,
    to support the "Allow Cropping" option.

  * Refactored the Layout class into a super- and sub-class, which should
	allow the relatively painless addition of alternative layout styles
	in the future.

  * Moved all the UI elements relating to the NUp layout into a composite
    widget, which again should allow the addition of alternative layouts
    in the future.

  * Added an optional cancel button to the progress indicator.

  * Both the TIFF saver and Printer now respect the cancel button.

  * Fixed a string-freeing error in stpui_widgets/stpui_printerselector.c.


PhotoPrint-0.2.0

  * First GUI-based release


PhotoPrint-0.1.0

  * Initial command-line driven utility.
